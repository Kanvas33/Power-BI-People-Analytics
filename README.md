# People Analytics Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a **Microsoft Power BI interactive dashboard** focused on **People Analytics** within the context of **Human Resources**. The project aims to **analyze active and inactive employees**, including those who have been terminated or left the company voluntarily. By leveraging the power of **data analysis and visualization**, the project seeks to provide valuable **insights for both the company and its employees**.

## Project Objectives

- Gather insights about both active and inactive employees to inform **data-driven decision-making**.
- Create an **interactiv**e Power BI dashboard to visualize and present the gathered data effectively.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Preparation (ETL)**: The data used in this project was **cleaned** and **transformed** using **Power Query** to ensure it was suitable for import into Power BI. This included handling missing values, data validation, and structuring the data for analysis.

- **Dashboard Design**: The graphics and visualizations used in the dashboard were carefully chosen to maximize the efficiency of data visualization. The dashboard includes three **main tabs**: **Active Employees, Inactive Employees, and Employee Summary**.

   - **Active Employees Tab**:
     - Sections: Departments (e.g., Administration, Production, IT, Sales), Employee Status, Job Position by Department, Monthly Salary vs. Employee Satisfaction Index, Employees by Gender (%), Recruitment Source.

   - **Inactive Employees Tab**:

   - **Employee Summary Tab**:
     - Sections: Departments (e.g., Administration, Production, IT, Sales), Employee Status (Active or Inactive), Dropdown Menu for filtering by Job Position, Reason for Leaving the Company, Employee Satisfaction Index, Salary, and Recruitment Source. Additionally, a complete Employee Summary table provides a comprehensive overview of all gathered information.
